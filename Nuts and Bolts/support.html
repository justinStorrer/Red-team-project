<h3>How to contact support</h3>

<p>Sweet Release is commited to customer satisfaction and that includes our customer support. Because ghosts can't use phones, contacting
support can be a bit more difficult. While you can see the instructions on this page, all these will be included in the Sweet Release package. 
To contact support, you must do the following.</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li>Visit our headquarters or one of our site locations</li>
	<li>Following the signs to our support section. A map is located in the lobby as well.</li>
	<li>Enter an unoccupied Ouija board booth where a trained professional team will constantly check if someone needs support.</li>

	<li>Now you just need to talk to our support team about your issue an we will solve your problem as fast as we can.</li>
</ol>
