<p>While ghosts are immune to almost anything, there are still things that can harm you. To ensure the best in your ghostly experience, stay away 
from the following</p>

<ul>
	<li>Any holy site. This includes churches, shrines, temples, or any other place of religious significance</li>
	<li>Anything round and yellow that says "waka waka". If you find yourself flashing blue, run away!</li>
	<li>Poltergust 3000 vacuum cleaners, Proton packs, Talismans, and holy objects like the Holy Handgrenade of Antioch</li>

<h3>Instructions for Eternal Youth<h3>

<p>Instructions for Eternal Youth are the same as Sweet Release with these additional steps.</p>

<ol type="1">
	<li>Send detailed information from your doctor about any physical or genetic conditions you have.</li>
	<li>Due to changes in genetics, you will need to fill out additional legal forms. This is to prevent being accused of identity theft 
	and to notify authorities of your genetic changes and changes in your looks to allow for proper identification.</li>
	<li>Schedule an appointment at one of our sites for your bodily transition. There will be a waiting period as cloning is not an instant process.
	Please also note that there will be a longer waiting period depending on any changes in your genetics.</li>
	
</ul>
